        "Loops are one of the most powerful things about computer programming as they are a way to systematically perform tasks several times. The most common one that you will use in python is a for loop but there are also while loops that you can use. When you are using a for loop you are doing a series of operations on successive elements of a class of objects called iterables. These could be strings, lists, tuples, arrays, vectors, series, or generators. If it looks like a list in python it is probably an iterable"

        "Why Python/Pandas? Why not Stata, R, or SAS? Certainly, each of those languages are used in empirical finance research. I think there are some important advantages to using `Python/Pandas`. One of the important reasons is that Python is a well designed a popular general purpose programming language. I think this makes Python/Pandas relatively easily to learn. I also think it provide `Pandas` with a more elegant syntax than the other languages (but that's obviously a subjective judgment on my part). Additionally, I think this general purpose base yields a side benefit to you. Specifically, learning a general purpose programming language has potentially large benefits for you even if you don't decide to pursue a PhD in Finance. Python is used in lots of different domains; it's not narrowly confined to the domain of quantitative finance or even scientific computing or data science.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main purpose of this `Jupyter` `notebook` is to introduce the `Pandas` `library` (the most important library for this course) and the `dataframe` (the main data object we rely on do to empirical work in the course). A secondary purpose of this notebook is to briefly show off the high level nature of `Pandas`; by high level, I mean you can get a lot done with a only a few commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**III. Introducing the Dataframe**\n",
        "\n",
        "What does `Pandas'` provide that helps with data analysis? The core object Pandas' provides is a container for holding rectangular array of mixed type data called a **dataframe**. You can think of a dataframe as the programming equivalent of a spreadsheet. The `dataframe` contains rows and columns of data where each column can be a different fundamental datatype: integers, floats, imaginary numbers, or strings. Analogous to a spreadsheet, Pandas' provides programmers with many ways to create new data, transform and combine data, aggregate data, or display data. For example, Pandas' has a built in operator (it's the standard division symbol, `/`) that allows one to divide one column into the other element by element. It also has much higher level functions that, for example, allow us to easily create graphs or plots of data. Many of these functions are built into the dataframe (these built in functions are typically called `methods` or `member` `functions` in the parlance of object oriented programming). So a dataframe isn't just a container for data; it also holds many functions that allow us to perform data analysis. That's why a dataframe is considering an object; it holds mix type data and it provides functions (methods) that allow us to manipulate, transform, and analyze data. The data an object can store, and the functions that can operate on the data define the object's identity (a dataframe in this case).\n",
        "\n",
        "**II. Accessing the Pandas Library**\n",
        "\n",
        "To use Pandas we have to tell Python that we want access to it. This is accomplished with Python's `import` command. As part of the import command I will also give the `Pandas` `library` a namespace. It's convention to use `pd` as the namespace (you can use a different name than `pd` but `pd` is a really strong convention for Pandas in the Python world ... most people will think you're weird if you use any other namespace convention). Given the `pd` namespace, Pandas' functions that we call will take the following form: `pd.function` (for example, `pd.read_csv`). Using namespaces is a good programming practice (habit) because it keeps your code tidier. It's makes it clearer what library a certain function or command comes from if each library you use has it's own namespace."

The data are in a csv file so we can read in the data using the `read_csv` function. The `read_csv` function will automatically create a `dataframe` object containing the data from the csv file. The `read_csv` function has a lot of options and flexibility (take a look at the [help page for it in Pandas' documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html)), but often you don't use any of them (particularly for well formed or non-messy csv files). Pandas can read many different datafile formats (e.g., Excel, SAS, SQL, and Stata), but in this class we will mainly work with csv files. Note, the csv file is actually stored on a web server. The `read_csv` function in `pandas`, of course, reads files stored on your local machine, but it also has no trouble reading file stored remotely; you just need to provide a URL."
